# This is the tip calculator we've made in our first three sessions at the Women Who Code iOS meetups at Coding Dojo!

### What it does:
1. Type in the amount of your bill
2. The tip calculator displays how much to tip for 10%, 15%, and 20% tips.
3. The tip calculator also displays the total amount (the bill plus tip) for 10%, 15%, and 20% tips.
4. Pressing the clear button resets the bill amount to zero.
5. Tapping one of the buttons at the top of each possible tip will trigger an alert to confirm whether the user would like to save this expense.
6. Confirming the save saves the expense's date, total bill amount, and tip percentage to Core Data.
7. Upon loading the app, all the expenses saved in the database are printed to the console.
